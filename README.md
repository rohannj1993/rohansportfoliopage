# rohansportfoliopage
Our task was to make a portfolio page. I was able to add an section which details my goals for the page, along with my name. I also added a contact me tag at the bottom of the page. I unfortunately could not cover up the blank white back ground of some of the page. Also I was not able to make the examples into two seperate rows. In addition I was unable to add an image to the surf report box. Most of the tools I used for this page were flexbox elements along with basic CSS elements.
